Here are some tips to help you stay cyber secure:

1. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, and use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords for you. You may check a list of strong passwords [here](https://pastebin.com/KwGHKHHn).
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password when logging in.
3. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments, especially in emails or messages from unfamiliar sources. Scammers often use these methods to try and trick you into giving away sensitive information or installing malware on your device.
4. Keep your software and devices up to date with the latest security patches and updates. These often include fixes for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.
5. Use a firewall and antivirus software to protect your device from malware and unauthorized access. Make sure to keep these programs up to date as well.
6. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive tasks, as they are often unencrypted and can be easily accessed by others. If you need to use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection.
7. Be careful when sharing personal information online, such as your full name, address, or financial information. Only share this information with trusted sources, and make sure the website you're sharing it with is secure (look for a padlock icon in the address bar).
8. Enable privacy settings on your social media accounts and be mindful of the information you share online. Scammers and hackers can use your personal information to steal your identity or gain access to your accounts.
9. Use a unique email address for online accounts, and avoid using your personal or work email for accounts that don't require it. This can help prevent spam and phishing attacks.
10. Use strong, unique passphrases for all your accounts instead of passwords. Passphrases are longer and more secure than passwords, and they are easier to remember.

By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyber attacks and protect your sensitive information online.
